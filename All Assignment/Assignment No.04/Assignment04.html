    <h1>***Ramkund***</h1>

        <img src="img/ram.jpg">
    </div><br>
    <p>The ancient epic Ramayana tells the tale of Rama, a Hindu prince and avatar of the god Vishnu who is forced into
        a 14-year exile from his kingdom of Ayodhya. His wife, Sita, and brother, Lakshman, follow him in his exile.
        Rama today is an important Hindu god, and the places associated with the Ramayana are now major pilgrimage
        sites. Once of these sites is Panchavati, where the trio spent several years during their exile. Panchavati, now
        in Nasik, has several places of interest and worship for pilgrims and those fascinated by the mythological epic.
        And the most important one is the Ramkund or Ram Kund, which literally translates to the pond of Ram. ALSO READ:
        Forts near Nashik that perfectly capture its history
        The Ramkund is revered because it is said to be the pond where Rama would take his bath. The holy pond is used
        to immerse the ashes of the dead, which are said to be immediately absorbed into its waters. Many even take a
        dip in the sacred waters of the Ramkund to wash away their sins. Another point of interest here is the nearby
        Gandhi Lake or Talab, with a memorial monument of white marble dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi. Part of the ashes of
        this great political leader were immersed in the Ramkund after his assassination in 1948.
